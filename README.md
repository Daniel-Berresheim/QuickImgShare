# Quick Image Share
A tool to quickly share images via Imgur.

This Windows tool is my first attempt to communicate with API's with OAuth 2 authentication. The main goal is to quickly upload images to Imgur to share them with friends.

The access token has to be placed in the folder "D:/InputData/AccessTokens/ImgurAccessToken.txt".

# Features:
* Drag and drop one or multiple images (png or jpg) on the application to upload them to imgur privately. The application displays a link to access the image.
* Includes function to download images by author and id.

# Possible future Expansion:
* download albums

# Open Bugfixes/Issues:
* png uploads do not work for big images, add functionality to automatically downscale them?
