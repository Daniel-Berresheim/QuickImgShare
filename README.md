# QuickImgShare
A tool to quickly share images via Imgur.

This Windows tool is my first attempt to communicate with API's with OAuth 2 authentication. The main goal is to quickly upload images to Imgur to share them with friends.

# Features:
* Drag and drop one or multiple images (png or a jpg) on the application to upload it to imgur privately. The application displays a link to access the image.

# Planned Features/Improvements:
* Option to configure the session id?
* download individual images
* download albums
* refactor structure with design patterns in mind
* general code rework
* asynchronous upload/download

# Open Bugfixes/Issues:
* png uploads do not work for big images, add functionality to automatically downscale them?
